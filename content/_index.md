## About Me
Justin Langhorst

{{% note %}}
- Hi, I'm Justin.
- Thank the host.
- Started a company about 7 years ago doing this type of work on the side
- Building websites
- Running local SEO and SEM campaigns to get clients more calls
- I discovered:
  - that I prefer to focus on the initial foundational work
  - building or revising websites
  - setting up a solid foundation for a businesses' online presence
  - and hand over the ongoing work back to the business

This talk is about setting up a solid foundation for your businesses' presence on the web

## What is Web Presence?
Increase your presence,<br>
get more (and better) clients.

{{% note %}}
- Think of it like your *digital footprint* on the web
- When done right:
  - allows people to find information about your business quickly and easily
  - this puts them one step closer to becoming a client
- But it's not just about people!
  - it's ALSO about computer systems and their ability correctly parse the information you're providing about your business
  - so they can display it in searches relevant to your offerings
- The way you structure your content is important for both
- and this ultimately brings more of the ideal type of client to your business

## Web Presence:
A **Hub** and **Spoke** Network.

{{% note %}}
Web presence is like a hub and spoke network, but one where the spokes are primarily serving and providing trust and authority to the central hub.

- Hub: a website hosted at your own domain name, something you have complete control over
- Spokes: external websites that reference your business and/or link back to your website hosted at your domain, something you don't have a lot of control (if any) over
{{% /note %}}

## The Goal
Attract more ideal clients.

{{% note %}}
- The whole point of doing any of this is to attract more ideal clients
- How do we do this?
- Increase our presence in local search
- By communicating clearly, consistently at our hub and also our spokes
{{% /note %}}

---

## Local Search
Why it's important.

{{% note %}}
- One of the things we're doing when increasing our presence of our local business on the web is trying to show up in local search results
- According to Google, 76% of people who conduct a local search on their smartphone visit a business within 24 hours, and 28% of those searches result in a purchase.
- Out of all Google searches, 30% are related to location
- What are they doing?
- Learning more about nearby businesses
- Reading reviews, around 14 minutes before making a decision
- Utilizing additional services on top of the original search
  - 55% use Google Maps
  - 44% Apple Maps
  - 39% Yahoo
  - 31% Bing 
- Do you need better web presence?
  - If you're happy with the amount of clients you're bringing in, maybe not
  - If you want to attract online or phone orders, appointment bookings, clinic visits, or other business from local consumers, the answer is probably yes

## An Example
Goode Coaching, LLC

{{% note %}}
- To better illustrate the concepts of web presence
- Fictitious business: Goode Coaching, LLC

What kind of coaching services? This could mean a lot of different things, right? So we can explore this a bit. 
{{% /note %}}

## The Hub
Your website hosted at your domain.

{{% note %}}
- The hub of your presence on the web is your domain name
- ex: goodecoaching.com
- Think of this as land
- Once you own it, you can build whatever you want on it
- So we want to turn this into something that works for our business
- That serves our business in a manner and automates as much of the work as possible
- So we can spend more of our time and energy serving clients + customers
- Less time doing work we don't want to keep repeating
- To do this, we have to get potential clients to our hub
- We'll start with content
{{% /note %}}

## Communicate
Who | What | When + Where | Why + How

{{% note %}}
- First things first, we have to start with the basics
- Who, What, When, Where, and Why, potentially How
- This seems obvious, but so many websites fail to deliver good answers to these questions
- And sometimes fail to answer a few them at all
- But, it's a little more complicated than just writing down the information
{{% /note %}}

---

## Content
for People *and* Computers

{{% note %}}
- Especially the factual information
  - The Who, What, When, and Where
- Be clear
- Be consistent
- Structured Data
  - Types of markup that provide clarity to computer systems of the data presented to users of your website
  - Schema
  - Rich Results (Rich Snippets)
  - Helps crawlers better comprehend website content
  - Improves the possibility of obtaining rich results which improve click-through rates

https://www.searchenginejournal.com/how-to-use-schema-for-local-seo-a-complete-guide/294973/
{{% /note %}}

---

## WHO
are you?

{{% note %}}
- Imagine having to answer this every time. Personally.
- Someone visits your website and they want to know about your business.
- But instead of having content that provides a good description of this, there's simply a button that calls you -- that FaceTimes you
- And you have to deliver the same information, answering slightly different questions but mostly the same ones, over and over again, to each individual person that's interested in your business
- We'll continue this example
{{% /note %}}

---

## WHAT
do you do?

{{% note %}}
- What services do you provide?
- Honestly, it's a good idea to take stock in this now if you haven't in a while
- How are you presenting what you do to each individual person who crosses your network of presence on the web?
- How are you serving potential clients with this information?
- Is it clear? Does it make sense to them? Is it what they're looking for?
- The better you can communicate what you do in very clear, precise terms, the less questions you will have to answer later
- And this also ties back to our goal of *attracting more ideal clients*
- If they know very clearly what you do and what you don't,
- hopefully that allows you as a business to attract the ones that really need or want what you have to offer, 
- and skip the calls or visits from the people who are not a good match for what you offer
{{% /note %}}

---

## WHEN and WHERE
do you do it?

{{% note %}}
- When do you provide the services that you do?
- And where do you provide them?
- There is usually markup for each, and the more clear you can make this data available to both people and computers, the more opportunities there are to increase your presence through local search results
{{% /note %}}

---

## WHY and HOW
do you do it?

{{% note %}}
- This is where you tell your story.
- While the nature of your business may prevent you from getting too personal here, I believe there is room to tell a story here.
- What sets you and your business apart from another? Why are you running this business? How do you operate? 
- This is also the type of information that can be good for content marketing
- For regular updates to your website, and across whatever social networks you choose to incorporate in your marketing efforts

Goode Coaching, LLC
4 stars - based on 250 reviews
123 Main St.
Dallas, TX 75201

www.goodecoaching.com
```

{{% note %}}
- Basic information
- The name of our business
- The address
- Phone number
- URL of our website
- And we're missing a few things for the sake of this example
- Namely, when we're open and what types of services we provide
- While this is easy to read for people, it's not as easy for computers to read
- And one of our goals is to get computer systems to display information about our business in relevant searches
- So we want to be as clear as possible to systems that are crawling our website for information

{{% note %}}
- A lot more complex, right?
- The same information as the previous slide
- And it can be presented to the user in the same manner as the previous slide
- But this markup makes it easy for search engines like Google to process this information
- Again, we're trying to be *clear* for both people *and* computers
- So all of the factual information, the Who, What, When, and Where, can be easily marked up like this to provide more clarity
- And, one of the goals is to improve local rankings
{{% /note %}}

## Website Pages
Home | Services | About | Contact 

{{% note %}}
- The home is your portal
- And in some cases, might be the only page you want to rank and people to visit
- But it's very likely that you'll want a page for each individual service you are providing, or
- Specifically, localized landing pages for each service you provide
{{% /note %}}

---

## Localized Service Pages
What you do and where you do it.

{{% note %}}
- the what you do and where you do it, possibly the why + how as well
- These are created specifically for ranking in organic local search
- Should be optimized with geo-specific keywords
- Optimized H1, H2, and H3 headings, writing keyword-optimized body content, including internal links, adding images, and optimizing for mobile search
- This is where really diving into the technical SEO side of things is so important, and making sure that every element on your website is described as clearly and consistently as possible
- Ex: H1: Coaching Services
  - H2: Cross-Country
  - H2: Track
{{% /note %}}

## Local Rankings
Relevance | Distance | Prominence

{{% note %}}
- 3 factors that Google and other search engines use for local search results
- Relevance
  - Refers to how well a local Business Profile matches what someone is searching for
  - And by Business Profile, this is something specific to Google that we'll get into a bit later
  - Complete and detailed information helps Google better understand your business and match your profile to relevant searches
  - ex: what type of coaching services do you provide?
- Distance
  - Refers to how far each potential search result is from the location term used in a search
  - If a location isn't specified, it's calculated based on where Google thinks you are
  - ex: "coaching services in dallas tx"
- Prominence
  - Refers to how well-known Google considers the business to be
  - Probably the most complex of the local ranking factor categories
  - ex: what other businesses link to you? especially those that are relevant to coaching services or providers
{{% /note %}}

## The Spokes
Lead back to the hub.

{{% note %}}
- The spokes lead back to the hub
- Replicate information at the spokes, and direct back to the hub, your website
- Information must be presented consistently at every spoke, match what's on your website
- Some examples
- Social Networks: Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, etc.
- Review Sites: Yelp, Glassdoor, Trip Advisor, CitySearch
- Sharing Sites: Reddit, forums
- Directories: Local and national niche or geo-specific directories
{{% /note %}}

---

## Google Business Profile
The most important spoke.

{{% note %}}
- If you don't already have your Google Business Profile claimed and completely filled out, that's what I'd recommend doing immediately
- GBP offers the greatest impact for brands seeking local exposure
- Complements your website (does not substitute)
- Increases your web presence with a Google profile
- The information provided can appear in both Google Search and Google Maps
- And any 3rd-party platform utilizing the Google Maps API will also show Google Business Profiles
- Again, fill the profile out as completely as possible!
- Use (but don't overuse) keywords that relate to your business
- Keep business operating hours accurate
- Add photos, add photos, add photos!
- Consider letting customers message you ...
- Use local posts
  - Keep presence fresh on Google
{{% /note %}}

## Reviews
A word on reviews.

{{% note %}}
- Interacting with customers by responding to their reviews illustrates that your business values its customers and the feedback that they leave regarding it
- Positive reviews are going to have a positive effect on potential customers when researching your business
- They also increase your business's visiblity in search results
- You can encourage customers to leave feedback by creating a link they can click to write a review for your business
{{% /note %}}

---

## Photos
A word on photos.

{{% note %}}
- Cover photo should showcase your brand page's personality
  - Large photo featured at the top of the brand's business profile, cropped to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio
- Interior photos help customers better understand the physical experience
- Videos are one of the most popular media forms on the web, use this medium to tell a story if possible
- Additional photos can be used to spotlight features of your business that customers consider when making purchasing decisions
  - Differ from the above
  - Examples: goods + services, business staff working with and/or assisting customers, exterior of the business and available parking
{{% /note %}}


---

## Bing Places
Similar to Google Business Profile.

{{% note %}}
- While nowhere near as popular as Google, Microsoft's Bing search is another free profile to utilize for Bing search
- Cover all the bases by setting up your Bing Places for Business
{{% /note %}}

---

## Social Listings
Claim your profile.

{{% note %}}
- Whether you plan to be active on social listings or not, claim your business on all of the popular social sites such as Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram
- If you don't plan on using them, make sure to pin a tweet or post inviting users to call/visit your website/follow you on whatever social platform you are most active on
- Many social profiles allow you to provide a link back to your website -- use it
  - it won't help local rankings, really, but it will help more people potentially discover what you have to offer
- It can be important to respond quickly, so don't overdo this, and focus on what makes sense for your business
{{% /note %}}

---

## Facebook Business

{{% note %}}
- Many people are comfortable with FB and use it as a search engine
- Make sure you at least create a business page and update it with your website, hours, and a description
- Social signals may have limited impact, but they do have an impact on social SEO
{{% /note %}}

---

## Online Directories
Local citations.

{{% note %}}
- Claim your business in other popular online directories, such as
- Apple Maps
- Yellow Pages
- Foursquare
- Yahoo's Localworks
- Consistent NAP!
- "Goode Coaching" and "Goode Coaching, LLC" are not the same 
{{% /note %}}

---

## Apple Maps
Yes, ~44% of use now.

{{% note %}}
- So many people miss this, but at least 44% of local searches end up with people utilizing Apple Maps
- Make sure people can find you within Apple Maps by ensuring that Apple has the correct information
{{% /note %}}

---

## Review Sites
Get listed.

{{% note %}}
- A study by Harvard Business Review shows the power of listing on review sites
- Their findings were that a business' one-star improvement in YELP rating leads to a 5-9% increase in revenue
- Yelp, Glassdoor, Angie's List
- AND they're also an opportunity for more people to learn about your business in more locations,
- and to get more relevant keywords associated with your domain
- Reviews with keywords and locations send signals to Google that you are a trusted local business
- And make sure you're responding to reviews ... both positive AND negative ... reviews build trust
